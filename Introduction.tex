\section{And Now, we Begin}
\label{sec:begin}

And now, here is an example paper citation \cite{paper1}, and a forward reference to Chapter \ref{chp:Background}.

If you use labels to refer to figures and document sections, then \LaTeX~will automatically re-number them when you move them around in a document. 

This template also uses the {\tt cite} package, which is configured to automatically sorts citations when provided in a list, even if the order does not match the order of appearance in the bibliography. For example, let's cite our papers in the reverse order they appear in the bibliography, and let \LaTeX~ automatically sort the citation list: \cite{paper3, paper2, paper1}.
